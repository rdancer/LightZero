"""
Wrapper for the evaluator.py script in the AutoML_Zero_Game repository.

That script currently doesn't work, and always returns (as of 27 April 2024 9am UTC) a value of ~0.35 for *any* program (even an empty program, or a program that should evaluate to 1.0). Yes, I've checked on multiple machines, and asked Marti about it.

So we wrap it, and when we fix it, we can fix it in this file, instead of going to the game.py, or changing the evaluator.py file.

TODO: Once the evaluator.py script is fixed, we can copy the known-working logic from there, and put it here.

Usage:

    `from my_evaluator import my_evaluate as evaluate`
